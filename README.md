# if_statements

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 5 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

We wrote basic conditional tests to evaluate to either `True` or `False`, and simple `if` statements, `if-else` chains, and `if-elif-else` chains to test and know when specific conditions have been met.
